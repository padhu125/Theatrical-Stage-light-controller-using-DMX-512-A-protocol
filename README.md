This project aims to create a multifunctional device for managing theatrical lighting through the DMX512-A protocol. The PC transmitter will receive commands from a computer via a virtual COM port and continually transmit a serial stream to control up to 512 devices on an RS-485 communication bus. On the other hand, the PC receiver will relay data received from the devices on the communication bus back to the PC through a virtual COM port. The design includes support for transmitting delayed actions on the DMX512-A bus to facilitate unattended operations. Devices connected to the bus will extract information from the asynchronous data stream to control one or more devices, and they will send acknowledgments to the controller when requested.
